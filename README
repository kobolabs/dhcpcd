dhcpcd - DHCP client daemon
Copyright (c) 2006-2014 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
./configure; make; make install
man dhcpcd for command line options
man dhcpcd.conf for configuration options
man dhcpcd-run-hooks to learn how to hook scripts into dhcpcd events


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need set the platform if OS is different
from the host.
--target=sparc-sun-netbsd5.0

If you're building for an MMU-less system where fork() does not work, you
should ./configure --disable-fork.
This also puts the --no-background flag on and stops the --background flag
from working.

You can change the default dirs with these knobs.
For example, to satisfy FHS compliance you would do this:-
./configure --libexecdir=/lib/dhcpcd dbdir=/var/lib/dhcpcd

We now default to using -std=c99. For 64-bit linux, this always works, but
for 32-bit linux it requires either gnu99 or a patch to asm/types.h.
Most distros patch linux headers so this should work fine.
linux-2.6.24 finally ships with a working 32-bit header.
If your linux headers are older, or your distro hasn't patched them you can
set CSTD=gnu99 to work around this.

Some BSD systems do not allow the manipulation of automatically added subnet
routes. You can find discussion here:
    http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-net/2008/12/03/msg000896.html
BSD systems where this has been fixed are:
    NetBSD-5.0

Some BSD systems protect against IPv6 NS/NA messages by ensuring that the
source address matches an address/prefix on the interface.
This is an error as the correct check is for on-link prefixes.
As such, on these systems stateful addressing via DHCPv6 may cause issues
trying to reach other neighbours.
BSD systems where this is known to be a problem
    Occured in NetBSD-5.0, fixed in NetBSD-6.99.29
    Occured in OpenBSD-4.2, fixed in OpenBSD-5.0

We try and detect how dhcpcd should interact with system services at runtime.
If we cannot auto-detect how do to this, or it is wrong then
you can change this by passing shell commands to --serviceexists,
--servicecmd and optionally --servicestatus to ./configure or overriding
the service variables in a hook.

Some systems have /dev management systems and some of these like to rename
interfaces. As this system would listen in the same way as dhcpcd to new
interface arrivals, dhcpcd needs to listen to the /dev management sytem
instead of the kernel. However, if the /dev management system breaks, stops
working, or changes to a new one, dhcpcd should still try and continue to work.
To facilitate this, dhcpcd allows a plugin to load to instruct dhcpcd when it
can use an interface. As of the time of writing only udev support is included.
You can disable this with --without-dev, or without-udev

To shrink dhcpcd you can disable IPv4 or IPv6:
	--disable-inet
	--disable-inet6

You can also move the embedded extended configuration from the dhcpcd binary
to an external file (LIBEXECDIR/dhcpcd-definitions.conf)
	--disable-embedded
If dhcpcd cannot load this file at runtime, dhcpcd will work but will not be
able to decode any DHCP/DHCPv6 options that are not defined by the user
in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.

To prepare dhcpcd for import into a platform source tree (like NetBSD)
you can use the make import target to create /tmp/dhcpcd-$version and
populate it with all the source files and hooks needed.
In this instance, you may wish to disable some configured tests when
the binary has to run on older versions which lack support, such as getline.
./configure --without-getline


Hooks
-----
Not all the hooks in dhcpcd-hooks are installed by default.
By default we install 01-test, 02-dump, 10-mtu, 10-wpa_supplicant,
15-timezone, 20-resolv.conf, 29-lookup-hostname and 30-hostname.
The default dhcpcd.conf disables the lookup-hostname hook by default.
The configure program attempts to find hooks for systems you have installed.
To add more simply
./configure -with-hook=ntp.conf


Compatibility
-------------
dhcpcd-5.0 is only fully command line compatible with dhcpcd-4.0
For compatibility with older versions, use dhcpcd-4.0
