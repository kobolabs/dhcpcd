dhcpcd-4 - DHCP client daemon
Copyright 2006-2008 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
Edit config.h to match your building requirements.

Take special note of ENABLE_DUID and unset it if the target media is 
volatile, like say a LiveCD.

Then just make; make install

man dhcpcd for command line options


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need to set the below knobs to avoid
automatic tests.
OS=BSD | Linux

You can change the default dir where dhcpcd stores it's .lease files with
DBDIR=/var/db

If you're building for a NOMMU system where fork() does not work, you should
add -DTHERE_IS_NO_FORK to your CFLAGS.

We now default to using -std=c99. For 64-bit linux, this always works, but
for 32-bit linux it requires either gnu99 or a patch to asm/types.h.
Most distros patch linux headers so this should work fine.
linux-2.6.24 finally ships with a working 32-bit header.
If your linux headers are older, or your distro hasn't patched them you can
set CSTD=gnu99 to work around this.

If you require compatibility with dhcpcd-3 and older style variables,
you can install dhcpcd-compat into the directory /etc/dhcpcd/enter-hook.d
We don't install this by default.
You should also add -DCMDLINE_COMPAT to your CFLAGS if you need to be fully
commandline compatible with prior versions.


Hooks
-----
We provide example exit hooks for looking up the hostname in DNS,
NTP (www.ntp.org) and ypbind (Linux).
There are not installed by default as they are platform dependant.
