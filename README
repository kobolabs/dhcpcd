dhcpcd-3 - DHCP client daemon
Copyright 2006-2007 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
Edit config.h to match your building requirements.

Take special note of ENABLE_DUID and unset it if the target media is 
volatile, like say a LiveCD.

Then just make; make install

man dhcpcd for command line options


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need to send HAVE_FORK=yes or HAVE_FORK=no
to the make command to avoid to automatic test.

We try and detect how to restart ntp and ypbind, you can override this with
HAVE_INIT=no or force one of these values
ORC      (OpenRC as used by Gentoo (forked from baselayout))
BRC      (BSD RC system - /etc/rc.d/ntpd restart )
SERVICE  (RedHat service command - service ntpd restart)
SYSV     (SYSV style - /etc/init.d/ntpd restart)

You can change the default dir where dhcpcd stores it's .info files with
INFODIR=/var/db
