dhcpcd-4 - DHCP client daemon
Copyright 2006-2008 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
Edit config.h to match your building requirements.
Then just make; make install
man dhcpcd for command line options


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need to set the below knobs to avoid
automatic tests.
OS=BSD | Linux

You can change the default dir where dhcpcd stores it's .lease files with
DBDIR=/var/db

If you're building for a NOMMU system where fork() does not work, you should
add -DTHERE_IS_NO_FORK to your CFLAGS.

We now default to using -std=c99. For 64-bit linux, this always works, but
for 32-bit linux it requires either gnu99 or a patch to asm/types.h.
Most distros patch linux headers so this should work fine.
linux-2.6.24 finally ships with a working 32-bit header.
If your linux headers are older, or your distro hasn't patched them you can
set CSTD=gnu99 to work around this.


Hooks
-----
We provide example exit hooks for looking up the hostname in DNS,
NTP (www.ntp.org) and ypbind (Linux).
There are not installed by default as they are platform dependant.


Compatibility
-------------
If you require compatibility with dhcpcd-3 and older style variables,
you can install dhcpcd-compat into the directory /etc/dhcpcd/enter-hook.d
We don't install this by default.
You should also add -DCMDLINE_COMPAT to your CFLAGS if you need to be fully
commandline compatible with prior versions.

dhcpcd-3 enabled DUID support by default - this has changed in dhcpcd-4.
You can enable it via the --duid, -D command line option or by using the
duid directive in dhcpcd.conf.
If CMDLINE_COMPAT is defined the we renable DUID support by default IF
the dhcpcd.duid file exits. This keeps the clients working as they were,
which is good.

dhcpcd-4 is NOT fully commandline compatible with dhcpcd-2 and older and
changes the meaning of some options.
