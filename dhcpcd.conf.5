.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd.conf
.Nd dhcpcd configuration file 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Although
.Nm dhcpcd
can do everything from the command line, there are cases where it's just easier
to do it once in a configuration file. Most of the options found in
.Xr dhcpcd 8
can be used here. The first word on the line is the option and the rest of the
line is the value. Leading and trailing whitespace for the option and value
are trimmed. You can escape characters in the value using the \ character.
.Pp
Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
.Pp
Here's a list of available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic option Ar dhcp-option
Requests the
.Ar dhcp-option
from the server. It can be a variable to be used in
.Xr dhcpcd.sh 8
or the numerical value. You can specify more seperated by commas, spaces or
more option lines.
.It Ic hostname Ar name
Sends specified
.Ar hostname 
o the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS. If
.Ar hostname
if a FQDN (ie, contains a .) then it will be encoded a such.
.It Ic fqdn Op none | ptr | both
none disables FQDN encoding, ptr just asks the DHCP server to update the PTR
record of the host in DNS whereas both also updates the A record.
.It Ic interface Ar interface
Subsequent options are only parsed for this
.Ar interface .
.It Ic leasetime Ar seconds
Request a leasetime of
.Ar seconds .
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
The default timeout for waiting for a DHCP response is 20 seconds which may
be too long or too short and can be changed here.
.It Ic classid Ar string
Change the default classid sent from dhcpcd-version. If not set then none
is sent.
.It Ic clientid Ar string
By default,
.Nm dhcpcd
sends a Client Node Identifier
.Rs
.%T "RFC 4361"
.Re
as the ClientID. Not setting anything causes the interface MAC address to
be sent instead. Otherwise, it sends the string specified. If the string
is of the format 01:02:03 then it encodes it.
.It Ic userclass Ar string
Tag the DHCP messages with the userclass. You can specify more than one.
.It Ic noarp
Don't send any ARP requests. This also disables IPv4LL.
.It Ic nogateway
Don't install any default routes.
.It Ic noipv4ll
Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one via DHCP.
