dhcpcd-3.0.3
NIS setup (yp.conf / domainname) works again.
Send hostname/fqdn and our parameter list in DISCOVER and INFORM messages too.
Add more debug messages.
Fix writing to resolv.conf when resolvconf not present.
Include linux/if_addr.h for 2.6.19+ kernels, thanks to AlexExtreme.

dhcpcd-3.0.2
Linux systems without glibc-2.3 don't have getifaddrs, so we define our own.
Changed the default timeout to 20 seconds, allowing hme Sparc drivers to work.
Set the rfds correctly so we can get a reply after re-sending a request.
Set the seconds elasped and maximum message size correctly in DHCP messages.
Now compiles on Linux 2.4 kernels. 
xmalloc dhcp objects so we can swap the pointers around easily.

dhcpcd-3.0.1
Quote all vars in the info file.
-n and -G options now work as stated in the man page.
Handle select loops with large timeouts and infinite lease times.
Correctly set the broadcast flag.
make_dhcp_packet already has byte ordered addresses, thanks to TGL
for the fix.
If we get a NAK then always re-enter the INIT state.

dhcpcd-3.0.0
A complete rewrite by Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>

Functional changes since version 2:
We now support FreeBSD as well as Linux.
RFC 3004 User Class support has been added.
RFC 3442 Classless Static Routes support has been added
(thanks to apexman for helping).
Options -r, -e, -v, -w, -B, -C, -D, -L, -S have been dropped.
-a now means "do arp" instead of "don't arp".
-o has been dropped, but we never bring down the interface anymore.
IP address is now required for the -s option.
-G no longer takes an IP address as an replacement gateway.
The .cache file is no longer created or used.
Default script is now /etc/dhcpcd.sh instead of /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe.
The .info file has changed slightly to better support mulitple entries with
more than one entity, such as route now having network,genmask and gateway.
We no longer create and restore .sv files as it's up to the interface
manager to restore them correctly as >1 dhcp client may be running.
