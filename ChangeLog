define ARPHRD_IEEE1394 if it doesn not exist, like for Linux-2.4 kernels.

dhcpcd-3.0.12
Test to see if the pid in the pidfile is actually running before claiming
that we are.
Fix the `netlink message truncated` error since 3.0.6.
We now ensure that our renewal and rebind times are sane.
Fix flushing interfaces for systems without getifaddrs and >1 interface.
All netlink error messages are now prefixed with netlink.
Add DHCP over FireWire 1394 (RFC 2855) and InfiniBand (RFC 4390) support.
We should add support for DUIDs (RFC 4361) as well.

dhcpcd-3.0.11
Don't try to send messages when we infinite leasetime and the interface
fd is closed.

dhcpcd-3.0.10
Only write a new ntp.conf if any of our servers are not present in it.
We now work with SIGCHLD and call wait so that we don't leave any
zombies lying around.
For infinite timeout, we now resent the last request at +TIMEOUT_MINI
intervals until TIMEOUT_MINI_INF is reached, thanks to siadak.
We now return a non zero exit code on SIGTERM and SIGINT if we have not
forked into the background.
When NIS and/or NTP servers are updated, we restart the service for them
if we can.

dhcpcd-3.0.9
Add static routes before any default routes as a router may require a host
route in the static routes.

dhcpcd-3.0.8
Fix arp checking.
linux header asm/types.h doesn't work with c99 which is just wrong,
so it's back to gnu99 until a working linux version is released.

dhcpcd-3.0.7
Allow Linux to use Token Ring again as Linux does not have any more hardware
specific code. BPF needs a patch for Token Ring support.
Dawin is now reported to work. NetBSD and OpenBSD should work also.
cleanmetas now inserts a \ when it finds a ' so we get the proper
values in our .info files when read by a shell.
Add new CFLAGS to ensure that the code quality is good.
Use const more in public functions.

dhcpcd-3.0.6
Don't set the broadcast flag anymore as all BPF and Linux sockets should be
able to unicast correctly.

dhcpcd-3.0.5
Fix yp.conf creation.

dhcpcd-3.0.4
Fix netmask thanks to Marc Duponcheel.
Send the hostname by default unless null, (none) or localhost.
This can be overridden by using a an empty option for -h (-h '').

dhcpcd-3.0.3
NIS setup (yp.conf / domainname) works again.
Send hostname/fqdn in DISCOVER and INFORM messages too.
Add more debug messages.
Fix writing to resolv.conf when resolvconf not present.
Include linux/if_addr.h for 2.6.19+ kernels, thanks to AlexExtreme.

dhcpcd-3.0.2
Linux systems without glibc-2.3 don't have getifaddrs, so we define our own.
Changed the default timeout to 20 seconds, allowing hme Sparc drivers to work.
Set the rfds correctly so we can get a reply after re-sending a request.
Set the seconds elasped and maximum message size correctly in DHCP messages.
Now compiles on Linux 2.4 kernels. 
xmalloc dhcp objects so we can swap the pointers around easily.

dhcpcd-3.0.1
Quote all vars in the info file.
-n and -G options now work as stated in the man page.
Handle select loops with large timeouts and infinite lease times.
Correctly set the broadcast flag.
make_dhcp_packet already has byte ordered addresses, thanks to TGL
for the fix.
If we get a NAK then always re-enter the INIT state.

dhcpcd-3.0.0
A complete rewrite by Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>

Functional changes since version 2:
We now support FreeBSD as well as Linux.
RFC 3004 User Class support has been added.
RFC 3442 Classless Static Routes support has been added
(thanks to apexman for helping).
Options -r, -e, -v, -w, -B, -C, -D, -L, -S have been dropped.
-a now means "do arp" instead of "don't arp".
-o has been dropped, but we never bring down the interface anymore.
IP address is now required for the -s option.
-G no longer takes an IP address as an replacement gateway.
The .cache file is no longer created or used.
Default script is now /etc/dhcpcd.sh instead of /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe.
The .info file has changed slightly to better support mulitple entries with
more than one entity, such as route now having network,genmask and gateway.
We no longer create and restore .sv files as it's up to the interface
manager to restore them correctly as >1 dhcp client may be running.

For ChangeLog for prior versions can be found in their tarballs.
